         the flours and salt into water and knead into a solid dough. Form the dough into a bar on a well-floured baking board, and cut the bar into 20 pieces. Form little balls from the pieces and then flatten them.
        
        Sprinkle some rye flour onto the baking board, and with a rolling pin, roll a piece of the dough into as thin a round crust as possible.
        
        When all the crusts are ready, fill the center of each crust with a thin layer of rice porridge. Fold the edges of the crusts and pinch tightly with your fingers forming oval shaped pies. (Turn the tips of the pies inwards to prevent them from burning during baking).
        
        Place the pies onto a baking tray covered with greaseproof paper, and bake at 275 – 300 degrees Celsius for 10 – 15 minutes, until golden brown.
        
        When the pies are removed from the oven, brush them with melted butter or a butter and water / milk mixture (I use 50 % butter and 50 % water. My mom instead doesn`t brush pies with anything).
        
        Place the pies onto a greaseproof paper and cover with a kitchen towel to soften.
        
        Food Serving Suggestion: Serve the Karelian Pies warm together with the Egg-Butter Spread.
